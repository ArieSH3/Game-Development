1.- Player character (pc):
(D)1.1- Simple movement on two axis (x,y) that feels crisp and responsive (Might add slight speed up and slowdown on starting and
        stopping the movement as to feel a bit more fluid but not be annoying to the player like they are walking on ice)
   1.2- Add a hitbox around a player on which he will receive damage and also where he will come in contact with objects and mobs
        so they cant pass trough them.
   1.3- Add an event that will signal to the 'Attack' class that the player wants to perform an attack and send which attack was
        performed

2.- Player attack hitbox event:
   2.1- When an attack event is received from the player any enemy that is within the players attack hitbox should be notified
        that they received damage and their code will act appropriately to it.

3.- Map:
   3.1- Design an area in which the whole map will be contained in and in which the little 'zones' the map is made of will be 
        randomly placed in (Prefferably a bigger map)
   3.2- Design little zones that will be scattered around the map (Will be reused) which will contain random resources, chests, 
        shops etc.
   3.3- 
   
4.- Enemies:
   4.1- Enemies will spawn randomly outside of players render distance and will slowly make their way towards the player. 
        Some will constantly turn towards the player but have a set max angle they can turn at once and others will just aim
        for the player once they spawn keep that path even if player moves after.
