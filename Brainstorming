Genre: Roguelite, Action roguelike, Action RPG, Bullet Hell, Infinite Horde 

GAME TYPE:
  * Game will be of slavic influence and be focused around the pagan gods which provide power and abilities to
      the player. Use of slavic symbols for calling forth greater powers of Gods might be a possibility.
      Since Gods will be a big part of the game I want to add their lore and make it influence how their buff works
      on the player a little bit.
  * Research a bit more about slavic 'white voice' since I potentially want it to be a part of the soundtrack for the game
      later on or even maybe somehow implemented in to the games mechanics (Music also similar to Witcher 3 soundtrack)
  * Visual style of game to be decided (so far either pixelated like 'Astral Ascent' or similar to 'MadWorld MMO'
      
  - Set on a procedural map (There will be multiple maps for progression)
  - Have a player start out with one ability
  - To be decided on how much control the player will have when it comes to their abilities or will they have a set timer in 
      which they go off and the way they will be aimed or will aiming be more random as well (Like some abilities in Spirit Hunter: Infinite Horde)
  - Enemies will come in either waves or have a constant influx (To be decided)
  - Player gathers experience (and some resources) when killing enemies which he will use to further upgrade the ability(ies)
  - Maps will have multiple resources scattered around them which the player can collect for games meta progression system
  - Map will be littered with common, elite, (rare) and BOSS mobs from which the player will need to kill all the bosses in order
      to officially complete the map.
  - Player can choose to go for map completion or create a build efficient for farming resources around the map in order to progress
      the builds further.
  

GAME FEATURES:
  - There will be a system of worship to the specific god/s in which their influence will determine how your powers/abilities
      are affected
  - Player will have access to the ability tree from which they can expand upon current abilities and their power as well as
      developing builds for other purposes and uncovering new gods
  - Possibly a crafting system where player will use resources farmed on maps to make weapons, armor and improve them
  - ** Maybe add a base system where the player will do all their crafting and spend time while not on maps and potentially be 
      able to improve the base and create worship spots for the KNOWN gods in order to draw more of their favor on the battlefield
